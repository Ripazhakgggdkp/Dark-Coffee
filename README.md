1. Install Stylish if you haven't already done so.
2. Manage installed styles -> Write new style, then add this line:
`@import url('http://rawgithub.com/Ripazhakgggdkp/Dark-Coffee/master/css/DarkCoffee.css');`
4. Change "Applies to" to URLs starting with http://www.thorgaming.com/feelthebeats/
5. Hit save, and you're done!

Using this method, the style will be loaded in around half a second for every page.

Installing with Greasemonkey (Firefox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome):
--------
###### Until theme picker functionality has been implemented, just load the CSS with Stylish
